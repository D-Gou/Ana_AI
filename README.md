# Ana_AI
Simple brazillian AI that searches for stuff on Wikipedia, plays music and videos from youtube and tells the time.
To activate her, say 'Ana'
- If you want to ask the time, say 'Ana, que horas s√£o?'. ('Ana, what time is it?')
- If you want to ask her to search for something online, say 'Ana, procure por ....' ('Ana, search for .....')
- If you want her to play a song or a video from youtube, say 'Ana, toque ....' ('Ana, play ....')

This is just the beginning, soon she'll have more cool features.
